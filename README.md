# BartMobileApp
Technologies used: node.js, PhoneGap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This web/mobile web application is based on the BART API to give the user information based on real time data. It displays station information and train schedule for the specified source and destination station. It is based on RESTful web services design. It is integrated with the Google maps API to show the train routes on the map. For this application I created a node.js server on an ubuntu instance in aws. The frontend is written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the mobile app is created using PhoneGap.
